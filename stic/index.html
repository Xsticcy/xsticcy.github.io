        <h1 id='header'> Why Stic? </h1>

        <h1 id='header'> How Stic makes my game faster and more organized? </h1>
        <p>With Stick you can get rid of a lot of loops and modulescripts.</p>
        <p>Stick has a signal system to communicate between scripts so you don't need to make Bindable Fuctions and loops for
        communication.
        </p>
        <p>With Stick, you can get rid of every object based value(Intvalues, BoolValues, etc), because Stic has a way,
        to make shared variables easily.</p>
        <p>Stick also has a custom service system, so you can create your own services and use them in any script!</p>
        <br>

        <h3>+ when there are more than one scripts in the example code, that doesn't mean you can't do that in one code!</h3>
